# JavaScript Variables and Constants - Exercises

## Task 1: Variable Declaration and Types
Create variables using `var`, `let`, and `const` to store your name, age, and whether you're a student. Log each to the console and observe the differences in scope.

## Task 2: Constant vs Variable
Define a constant `PI = 3.14159` and a variable `radius = 5`. Calculate the circle's area and circumference. Try reassigning the constant to understand the error.

## Task 3: Type Conversion
Create variables with string numbers (`"42"`, `"3.14"`). Convert them to actual numbers using `parseInt()`, `parseFloat()`, and `Number()`. Compare the results.

## Task 4: Variable Naming and Scope
Write a function that declares variables in local and global scope. Demonstrate how `let` and `const` differ from `var` regarding block scope using an `if` statement.

## Task 5: Working with Multiple Declarations
Declare 5 variables at once using destructuring (e.g., `const [a, b, c] = [10, 20, 30]`). Swap their values and print the results.
